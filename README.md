# D3JS-Coffee-Dashboard

This project is a coffee dashboard built using D3.js. It provides an interactive visualisation of various coffee-related metrics.

## Data Source

The chosen coffee dataset is from Kaggle:

- [simplified_coffee.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schmoyote/coffee-reviews-dataset?resource=download&select=simplified_coffee.csv)

## Ways of Working

This section of the `README` outlines the processes/practices that should be followed throughout this project:

- Tickets (on the project JIRA board) are created collaboratively to ensure the ticket content and acceptance criteria are agreed
- All ticketed work should be carried out against a feature branch, which is branched from the `integration` branch
- Branch names shoulld follow the following structure, where `X` is replaced with the number of the ticket being worked on
  - `feature-DCDX-a-brief-description-of-the-ticket`
- Pull request titles should match the branch name of the feature
- Pull request description should contain a brief overview of the work carried out for that ticket
- Pull requests should be reviewed by at least one collaborator, before being approved
- Pull request reviewers should review against the acceptance criteria on the feature ticket
- Upon pull request approval, commit history should be squashed and the feature branch should be deleted
